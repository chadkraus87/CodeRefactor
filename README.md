# Horiseon - SEO & Brand Management Optimization

## Description

This replicates a marketing page for a marketing landing page. I have refactored both the HTML and CSS to improve SEO visibility and accessbility features. Including semantic tags, by adding an h1, a main, and a footer to meet Google Standards. Adding alt tags to images for accessibility readers.
